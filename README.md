# Sowing Success: Crop Selection using Logistic Regression

This project identifies the most important soil metric for predicting the optimal crop to grow, 
based on soil measurements of nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and pH. Logistic 
Regression is used to evaluate the predictive performance of each feature.
